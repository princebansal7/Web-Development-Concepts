- How can we Minimize this re-rendering behavior (Parent to child)
   - **Way-1: push the state where re-rendering required**
   - To minimize, push down the state to the `lowest common ancestor (LCA)` of the child where the state is required and not put the state in root
   - why LCA ? so that sibling children can have the propagated state changes too (via their common parent)
   - Check example here: [Click](https://github.com/princebansal7/Web-Development-Concepts/blob/main/react-js/07.react-minimize-renders/src/App.jsx)
