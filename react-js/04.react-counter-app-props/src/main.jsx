import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'
import App from './App.jsx'


ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <App />
)

// taking root element and rendering application in it
// ReactDOM helps in DOM manipulation like we learned
// <App/> is a component which will be rendered in app
