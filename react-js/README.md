# React Basics and need

- We previously saw in [DOM Manipulation](https://github.com/princebansal7/Web-Development-Concepts/blob/main/dom-manipulation/03.todo.html) we saw the need of `react` and `react dom`
- In `static` website we don't need react but in `Dynamic` websites where content is getting changed as per user activity, `React` removes a lot of headache which if we simply use DOM manipulation, we can't avoid.
- Counter (using DOM Manipulation) | [link](), we need to write a lot of code for such simple DOM Manipulation and to make it dynamic.
- In Real world applications like LinkedIn, facebook have lot of dynamic content so DOM code gets much complex.
- So, people realized it's hard to do DOM Manipulation in conventional way
- So, There were different libraries came into the picture which made DOM Mani. slightly easy but still for complex big apps it was still hard (**JQuery**)

## Why React JS?

- Eventually ReactJS/VueJs created new syntax to do Frontend and under the hood react compiler converts code to **HTML/CSS/JS**
- So libraries like React Js, which uses complex DOM manipulation under the hood keeping developer side code simple and efficient.
- React is just easier way to write **HTML/CSS/JS**
- It's a new syntax which under the hood gets converted into **HTML/CSS/JS**
